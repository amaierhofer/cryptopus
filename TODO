Main features until beta phase:
- Extract some of the functions of the old login controller into new controllers
- New login controller that supports more than just LDAP.
- Views refactoring and redesign
- Admins should be able to do recrypt requests for non-private accounts

Additional features and wishes
- Display time of last successful login if the password has changed
- Hide Password somehow (c&p should still work)
- Ability to generate passwords directly in cryptopus (with settings?)
